# Middleman boilerplate

At [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com) we use [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) to create static sites for our products. From simple sites to complex static applications, `middleman` fits all our requirements.

For this reason, we've created this boilerplate with the basic configuration of our static site projects. This boilerplate includes:

* Basic middleman configuration
* Folder structure
* Javascript example file
* CSS example structure
* Bitnami Design System
* HAML template engine
* A `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose` file to run the project with one command

We recommend you the [middleman documentation site](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/install/). There you will find useful tutorials, videos and advanced configuration guides.
